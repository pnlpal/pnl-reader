            PNL Reader was inspired by real user needs and my own search for a
            better reading experience online. It all began with
            <a
              href="https://pnl.dev/topic/914/why-dictionariez-does-not-recognize-selected-text-in-reader-focus-mode"
              target="_blank"
              >a community discussion</a
            >
            about the challenges of finding a simple, privacy-friendly reader
            mode that works seamlessly with
            <a
              href="https://github.com/pnlpal/dictionariez?tab=readme-ov-file#dictionariez"
              target="_blank"
              >Dictionariez</a
            >
            -- another browser extension I created for instant dictionary
            lookup. With Dictionariez, you can double-click any word on a
            webpage to see its meaning and open a full dictionary entry in a
            popup.
            <br /><br />
            <a
              href="https://github.com/pnlpal/dictionariez?tab=readme-ov-file#dictionariez"
              target="_blank"
              ><img

                alt="Dictionariez All-in-One"
            /></a>
            <br /><br />
            Motivated by feedback from users who wanted a no-nonsense reader
            mode that respects privacy and integrates well with Dictionariez, I
            set out to build PNL Reader. It’s designed to make reading easier,
            distraction-free, and more enjoyable while keeping your privacy in
            mind.

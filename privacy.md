# Privacy Policy

## Our Commitment to Privacy

We deeply respect your privacy and are committed to protecting your personal information. This extension is designed with privacy-first principles, operating locally on your device and only transmitting data when you explicitly request premium services.

## Data Collection and Storage

**Free Features:** This extension does not collect any browser information or user data for its core reading features, nor does it store any information on any server. While the extension may alter the page structure when activated by the user, it does not collect any personal information from the web page.

**Extension Activation:** The extension only processes data when you actively use it. When the extension is dormant or not activated, no data is collected, processed, or transmitted.

## Premium Features (Pro Plan)

**Text-to-Speech and Translation Services:** When using premium features such as text-to-speech or translation services, the extension transmits only the selected text content to our servers for processing. This data transmission occurs only when you actively use these features.

**User Accounts:** Premium services require user account registration for access control and service delivery. We use cookies and local storage to maintain your login session and preferences.

**What We Send:**
- Selected text content for processing
- Language preferences for translation/speech synthesis
- Account authentication information
- No browsing history, personal files, or unrelated device data

**Data Handling:**
- Text content is processed in real-time and not permanently stored
- Account information is securely stored and used only for service provision
- Processing occurs only for the duration of the service request
- Cookies are used solely for authentication and user preferences

## Free Trial

Users receive complimentary trial usage of premium features. During trial usage, the same data transmission and account policies apply as described above for premium features.

## No Tracking

We do not track user behavior beyond what is necessary for service delivery, collect analytics for advertising purposes, or maintain browsing profiles. The extension operates locally on your device except when premium services are explicitly requested.

## Data Retention

Text content sent for text-to-speech and translation processing is not retained after processing is complete. We do not build content databases or user profiles from your text. Account information is retained only as long as necessary for service provision and as required by law.
